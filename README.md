## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ (Mainly for personal use) Build uboot & ImmortalWrt Firmware for CMCC-XR30.

## üîß Usage

Just trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, the uboot and firmware will be built automatically.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Options

- [ ] Use luci-app-mtk wifi config

1. Use luci-app-mtk wifi config:

The option is disabled by default, meaning the workflow will use the `mtwifi-cfg` configuration tool. To use the old `luci-app-mtk` wireless configuration tool, please check the box.

- **mtwifi-cfg**: A wireless configuration tool designed for `mtwifi`, compatible with OpenWrt's native `luci` and `netifd`. It allows for fewer adjustments to the wireless driver parameters but offers a more aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface. As a newly developed tool, it may have some issues.
- **luci-app-mtk**: A configuration tool derived from the `mtk-sdk`, which needs to be used in conjunction with the `wifi-profile` script. It allows for almost all wireless driver parameters to be adjusted but has a relatively simple interface.
